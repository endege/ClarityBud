## Local Setup & Running

Follow these steps to get ClarityBud running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18.x, v20.x or later recommended)
*   npm (v9.x, v10.x or later) or yarn

### 1. Clone the Repository (or Download Project Files)

If you have the project as a Git repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/endege/ClarityBud.git
cd claritybud
```
If you downloaded the project files, navigate to the project's root directory.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using npm or yarn:
```bash
npm install
```
or
```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```
or
```bash
yarn dev
```
This will start the Next.js development server, usually on `http://localhost:9002` (as configured in `package.json`).

### 4. Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9002` (or the port shown in your terminal for the Next.js app).

## Database

*   ClarityBud uses **SQLite** for data storage.
*   The database file, `claritybud.sqlite`, will be automatically created in the root of your project directory when you first run the application.
*   On the first run with an empty database, the application will perform an initial data seeding with mock categories, transactions, and budgets to help you get started. This seeding is a one-time operation.

## Building for Production

To create a production build:
```bash
npm run build
```
And to run the production build:
```bash
npm run start
```
Ensure any necessary production environment variables are set in your deployment environment.
